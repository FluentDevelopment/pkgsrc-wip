Grit gives you object oriented read/write access to Git repositories via Ruby.
The main goals are stability and performance. To this end, some of the interactions
with Git repositories are done by shelling out to the system's git command, and
other interactions are done with pure Ruby reimplementations of core Git functionality.
This choice, however, is transparent to end users, and you need not know which method
is being used.
This software was developed to power GitHub, and should be considered production ready.
An extensive test suite is provided to verify its correctness.
